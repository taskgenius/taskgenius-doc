## 1. Privacy-First Design

<div className="p-4 border border-fd-primary/20 rounded-md bg-fd-primary/5 my-4">
  **The Task Genius Desktop App is designed with privacy as the foundational principle. Your data stays on your device.**
</div>

The desktop application operates entirely on your local machine. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data, analytics, telemetry, or usage statistics.

## 2. What Data We Do NOT Collect

- No usage analytics or telemetry
- No crash reports or error tracking
- No personal information or identifiers
- No task content, notes, or file data
- No device information or system details

## 3. Local Data Storage

All application data is stored locally on your device:

- **Tasks and Projects:** Stored as files in your chosen directory
- **Settings and Preferences:** Stored in local application data
- **API Keys:** Encrypted and stored locally in your device's secure storage

## 4. AI Integration and External Services

Task Genius Desktop offers optional AI-powered features:

### User Consent Required
AI features are opt-in. Your task data is only sent to external AI services (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or others) with your explicit consent.

### Your API Keys
You can provide your own API keys for AI services. These keys are encrypted and stored securely on your local device.

### Optional Subscription
Alternatively, you may subscribe to use Task Genius-provided AI services. Even then, we process your requests but do not retain your task content.

### Third-Party Privacy Policies
When using external AI services, those providers' privacy policies apply to the data you send them. We recommend reviewing their terms:

- [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)
- [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## 5. Automatic Updates

Task Genius Desktop checks for updates periodically:

- Update checks are performed by fetching version information from GitHub releases
- No system information, version numbers, or identifiers are sent during update checks
- Automatic updates can be disabled in settings if you prefer manual updates

## 6. Future Cloud and Team Services (Optional)

In the future, Task Genius may offer optional cloud-based team collaboration features:

### End-to-End Encryption
Any data synchronized to our servers will be protected with end-to-end encryption, ensuring only you and your team can access it.

### Account System
Cloud services will require account creation for authentication and subscription management.

### Data Retention
Server data will be retained for the duration of your subscription. After subscription expiration, all server-stored data will be permanently deleted within **30 days**.

### Server Location
Cloud services will be hosted in the **United States**.

### Always Optional
Cloud features will always remain optional. You can continue using Task Genius entirely offline without any cloud services.

<div className="p-4 border border-fd-border/50 rounded-md bg-fd-muted/20 mt-4">
  **Note:** Cloud and team features are not currently available. When they launch, this privacy policy will be updated with specific details, and you will be notified before opting in.
