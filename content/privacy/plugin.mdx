## 1. Zero Data Collection

<div className="p-4 border border-fd-primary/20 rounded-md bg-fd-primary/5 my-4">
  **The Task Genius Plugin does not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data.**
</div>

All your tasks, notes, and settings remain entirely within your local Obsidian vault. We have no servers, no analytics, and no tracking mechanisms.

## 2. Local Storage Only

All data is stored locally in your Obsidian vault:

- All data is stored locally in your Obsidian vault as markdown files
- Plugin settings are stored in Plugin's data.json. Usually `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-task-genius/data.json`
- No cloud synchronization or external storage
- You have complete control over your data

## 3. Open Source Transparency

The Task Genius Plugin is released under the **Functional Source License, Version 1.1** with an **Apache License v2.0 Future License**.

The source code is publicly available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/taskgenius/taskgenius-plugin), ensuring complete transparency about how the plugin operates.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The plugin does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs. Your workflow remains completely private and offline.

## 5. Updates and Installations

Plugin updates are distributed through the Obsidian Community Plugins repository. When you install or update the plugin, Obsidian may communicate with its servers, but Task Genius itself does not participate in this process or collect any information.
